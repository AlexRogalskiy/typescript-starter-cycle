A simple project for getting started with TypeScript in cycle.js, using Webpack.

##### Visual Studio Code Specifics
This repository has workspace settings and launch configuration for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as candy. The launch configuration will only work when the [Debugger for Chrome extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code) is installed. The [npm Script Runner extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script) for Visual Studio Code is also recommended.

##### Notes
> If hosting on github-pages, you need to remove `dist` entry in the `.gitignore` file.
